# 🎯 NUMBER GUESSING GAME

A simple Python-based number guessing game where the computer selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game features two difficulty levels: Easy(10 attempts) and Hard (5 attempts).

## 🧠 HOW IT WORKS:-

- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
  
- The user selects a difficulty level: `easy` or `hard`.
  
- The player makes guesses, and the program provides feedback:
  
  - "Too high" if the guess is higher than the answer.
    
  - "Too low" if the guess is lower than the answer.
    
  - If the guess is correct, the game ends with a success message.
    
- The player loses if they run out of attempts before guessing correctly.
